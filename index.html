              <div class="text-col">Dear Reader,</div>
              <div class="text-col">
                I warmly welcome you to another great time in the study of
                God&apos;s Word. All through this month, we shall be considering
                the secrets that make for a successful family life. my prayer is
                that your eyes of understanding shall be opened to catch this
                truth from God&apos;s Word in Jesus name.
              </div>
              <div class="text-col">
                It is important for us to understand what marriage is all about.
                Many people, including Christians, have a misconception about
                marriage. Some think that it is just the coming together of a
                man and a woman and their bearing children that is marriage.
                Some others think that it is a kind of friendship or
                relationship.
              </div>
              <div class="text-col">
                Scripturally, marriage is a covenant and until you have this
                understanding, you may never enjoy fulfilment in your family.
                Marriage is a covenant between God and the couple, in the first
                instance, and then between the couple themselves. So, when you
                are entering into a marriage relationship, it is important for
                you to know that you are entering into a covenant with God and
                with your spouse. Malachi 2:14 says: Because the LORD hath been
                witness between thee and … the wife of thy covenant.
              </div>
              <div class="text-col">
                What is a covenant? A covenant is an agreement between two
                people. It is a relationship that must not be broken and if it
                is ever broken, a penalty follows suit. A covenant is also for a
                lifetime and I believe strongly that it is because a covenant is
                for a lifetime that the Word of God says in Ecclesiastes 10:8:
                He that breaketh the edge, a serpent shall bite him. A promise
                can be claimed, but a covenant cannot. In a covenant, you have
                to abide with some rules and regulations and as you do these you
                enjoy the benefits it contains. When you walk in terms with the
                covenant, God fulfils His own part of the covenant.
              </div>
              <div class="text-col">
                Success in marriage is not a function of prayers. It is
                basically, a function of walking in the terms of the covenant.
                The only place prayer is needed is for divine grace to walk in
                line with the demands of the covenant. Prayer can never take the
                place of obedience to the terms of the covenant. Therefore,
                instead of going from place to place seeking solution to the
                problems of your family, settle down for knowledge of your
                covenant responsibility and stay committed to its fulfilment
                thereof. It is in the doing of that covenant responsibility,
                that your desire lies.
              </div>
              <div class="text-col">
                The marriage covenant is best described as a triangle, with God
                on top or at the apex, and the man and his wife at the bottom or
                the base, everyone playing their part independently … As unto
                the Lord. (Ephesians 5:22). God created you and made you a part
                of that family for a purpose and you will be accountable to Him
                for the fulfilment of that purpose. Husband and wife have
                covenant obligations to each other for which they will also be
                held accountable. Your responsibility to obey the terms of the
                covenant is not dependant on your spouse fulfilling his or her
                own part. As far as God is concerned, you have been given an
                individual responsibility and you must be accountable to Him for
                its fulfilment.
              </div>
              <div class="text-col">
                The failure on the part of your spouse for the non-performance
                of his or her responsibility is not a sufficient excuse for the
                non-performance of yours. For instance, as a man, you cannot say
                the failure of your wife to submit to your headship is the
                reason you cannot love her. The same goes for the woman; whether
                your husband loves you or not, you are under an obligation to
                submit to him in everything. When you fulfil your own part of
                the covenant, God will also fulfil His own part which is to give
                you peace, joy, fulfilment and every good thing you desire in
                your family. God is constant; His side is stable; He
                doesn&apos;t change (Malachi 3:6); He is the same yesterday,
                today and forever (Hebrews 13:8). He will do whatever He says He
                will do. What does that mean? Whatever good you see God do for
                any family, He can do the very same thing for you because He is
                no respecter of persons. If he has to change your spouse in
                response to your obedience, he will do it.
              </div>
              <div class="text-col">
                The Bible says: The king&apos;s heart is in the hand of the
                LORD, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he
                will (Proverbs 21:1). The turning of your spouse&apos;s heart is
                but a light thing with the Lord for with Him nothing shall be
                impossible. You just concentrate on pleasing Him by your
                obedience to His command and He will please you by the
                fulfilment of His part of the covenant.
              </div>
              <div class="text-col">
                When your covenant relationship with God is in place, your
                covenant relationship with your spouse becomes a very easy thing
                to observe. If you get committed to obeying the Lord, by either
                loving your wife or submitting to your husband, you will find
                out that it becomes a thing of joy for you to do. It becomes a
                delight to show love or submit. It is no longer mechanical but
                spontaneous, and all that could ever be desired in a home
                becomes cheaply yours.
              </div>
              <div class="text-col">
                God is a God of covenant and the benefits of the covenant are
                only available to those who have a covenant relationship with
                Him. He said in his Word: Gather my saints together unto me;
                those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice Psalms
                50:5. You can become a part of those in covenant with Him by
                praying this simple prayer with me inviting Jesus Christ into
                your heart as your Lord and personal Saviour: Dear Lord Jesus
                Christ, I come to You today. I am a sinner. Forgive me my sins
                and cleanse me with Your Blood. I accept You as my Lord and
                personal Saviour. Make me a child of God today. Thank You for
                delivering me from sin and satan to serve the living God and
                thank You for accepting me into Your Kingdom.
              </div>
              <div class="text-col">
                Congratulations! If you prayed this simple prayer of faith with
                me, you are now born again and a child of God. He loves you and
